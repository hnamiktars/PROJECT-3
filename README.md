# Korean Named Entity Recognition (NER) Dataset

## Project Summary

This project focuses on annotating Korean text data for Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to identify and label key entities such as person names, locations, organizations, dates, and numerical expressions.

This dataset was manually annotated using Excel based on a structured annotation guideline created specifically for this project.

This project was developed as part of a personal data annotation portfolio to simulate real-world AI dataset preparation workflows.

## Objectives

- Practice Korean NER annotation
- Develop practical data labeling skills
- Create structured annotation guideline
- Improve attention to detail and consistency
- Understand real-world NLP data preparation process

## Entity Label Set

The dataset includes the following entity categories:

| Label | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| PERSON | Name of a person | 김민수 |
| LOCATION | City, country, address | 서울, 부산 |
| ORGANIZATION | Company, institution, school | 삼성전자, 서울대학교 |
| DATE | Specific date | 2024년 3월 15일 |

---

## Annotation Method

Annotation was performed manually using Microsoft Excel.

Annotation format example:

| Sentence | Entity | Label |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 김민수는 서울에 갔습니다 | 김민수 | PERSON |
| 김민수는 서울에 갔습니다 | 서울 | LOCATION |

## Annotation Workflow

1. Prepared Korean sentence dataset
2. Defined entity categories
3. Identified entities in each sentence
4. Assigned appropriate entity labels
5. Reviewed annotations for consistency
